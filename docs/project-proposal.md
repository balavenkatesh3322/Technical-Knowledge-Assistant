## 1. The Challenge: Unlocking Trapped Knowledge
Ramboll's engineers and consultants require rapid access to technical standards, best practices, project histories, and regulatory information. Current challenges include:

- **Time-Consuming Searches**: Manually navigating document libraries or relying on colleagues wastes valuable engineering hours.
- **Inefficient Processes**: Scattered information across systems hinders comprehensive research.
- **Inconsistencies**: Varied interpretations of data can lead to inconsistent project execution.
- **Onboarding Barriers**: New team members struggle with navigating complex knowledge bases.

This "knowledge retrieval gap" slows project timelines, reduces efficiency, and risks inconsistent application of best practices.

## 2. Our Solution: Technical Knowledge Assistant
The Technical Knowledge Assistant is an AI-powered microservice delivering rapid, accurate, and contextually relevant answers to technical queries from Ramboll’s documentation, using natural language processing.

## 3. How It Works: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
The system leverages **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate, sourced answers:

1. **Knowledge Ingestion**: Processes documents (e.g., Ramboll’s internal corpus) into chunks, indexed in a Vector Database for efficient search.
2. **User Query**: Engineers ask questions in natural language (e.g., "What are seismic design considerations for steel structures in Zone 4?").
3. **Intelligent Retrieval**: Searches the Vector Database for relevant document passages.
4. **Contextual Generation**: A Large Language Model (LLM) generates a concise answer using retrieved passages.
5. **Cited Answers**: Provides responses with source citations for verification.

### Why RAG?
- **Reduces Hallucinations**: Grounds answers in trusted documents, ensuring accuracy.
- **Up-to-Date Information**: Reflects the latest documents without retraining the LLM.
- **Transparency**: Citations build trust and enable further exploration.
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverages pre-trained LLMs, avoiding costly custom training.

## 4. Key Benefits & Value Proposition

## 5. Use Cases & User Scenarios
The Assistant supports key tasks:

- **Finding Standards**: "What is the fire resistance rating for steel columns in Type VB construction?" → Cites specific standards.
- **Understanding Principles**: "Explain tuned mass dampers for tall buildings." → Summarizes technical guides.
- **Past Project Insights**: "What were soil stabilization challenges in the City Center tower project?" → Summarizes project reports.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: "What are California’s stormwater runoff regulations?" → Summarizes relevant regulations.
- **Troubleshooting**: "What causes HVAC system vibrations and remedies?" → Lists solutions from case studies.
- **Material Comparisons**: "Compare A36 vs. A572 Grade 50 steel tensile strength." → Extracts data from specs.

### Time Savings with RAG
- **Targeted Retrieval**: Pinpoints relevant document sections.
- **Synthesized Answers**: Delivers concise responses, reducing manual reading.
- **Citations**: Enables quick access to sources for deeper exploration.

## 6. Technical Foundation
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (high-performance APIs), Celery (asynchronous tasks).
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL (job data), Redis (caching, queuing).
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers (LLM, e.g., Mistral-7B), Sentence Transformers (embeddings), ChromaDB (vector database).
- **Deployment**: Docker/Docker Compose for consistent, scalable deployment.
- **Observability**: Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring.

## 7. Upcoming Features
- **Rich User Interface (UI)**:
  - Web-based UI using React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, intuitive experience.
  - Dashboard for querying, viewing results, and managing data with drag-and-drop uploads.
  - Real-time query status and exportable results (PDF, CSV).
- **Data Ingestion via UI**:
  - Upload documents (PDFs, DOCX, CAD metadata) with metadata tagging.
  - Bulk upload and real-time validation for efficient ingestion.
- **API Access from UI**:
  - Visual query builder for API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/ask`, `GET /api/v1/ask/{id}`).
  - Displays formatted answers, citations, and job status.
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - SSO integration (Azure AD, Okta) with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Role-based access control for secure data access.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**:
  - Autocomplete search and filters (document type, date, project).
  - Saved searches for recurring queries.
- **Collaboration Features**:
  - Commenting and sharing results via Teams/Slack.
  - Links to query results or documents.
- **Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Tracks usage, query trends, and system performance.
  - Admin view for ingestion monitoring and ROI reporting.
- **Offline Support**: Cached results and PWA capabilities for mobile access.

## 8. Proposed Roadmap
